My codes for the problem statements in round 3
I was able to complete only 1 question. First of all i figured out on how does the sensor communicates with the MCU and read the datasheet provided by the company on what are the program codes to communicate
with the sensor. And then wrote simple Cpp functions to read data from the sensor.
